Project submission for the `Global Travel Hackathon in London, by AllerG Gator team`.

**Travelling is tough when you cannot find anything to eat. Let's solve the food problem for those travelling with dietary restrictions**

## :books: Description

* We are tackling Accessibility. It is estimated that ~10-40% of adults suffer from at least one allergy. Including also the vegetarian/vegan/kosher/halal/sugarfree... diets, there are many people who find eating while abroad harder. We want to make travelling more accessible.
* The react is a React project with express/node and a postgres db
* We are using the orbit.kiwi library, for the frontend.
* We collected initial data from FindMeGlutenFree.com and Zomato.com. We scraped many other websites in order to get restaurant information. If we had more time, we would use the Google Duplex api to make calls and verify, as well as creating a data pool from yelp/google reviews and seeing if they mention anything about vegetarian/vegan/... diet options, in order to create a likelihood of whether or not a restaurant has the options.
* The main technical challenge was collecting the data, and while we have started with manually sorting through a small dataset, we feel this could be automated.
